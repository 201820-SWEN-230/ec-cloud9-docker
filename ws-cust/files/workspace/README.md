Hi there UIndy Students! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

To get you started with C, we have created a small hello world
application and a Makefile as well as an environment customized
for the needs of SWEN-230 (Advanced C Programming).

Have a look at the file, and use the terminal to build them:

    $ make
    $ ./hello-c-world

We're sure you can take it from there. Go ahead and edit the code, 
or add some new files. It's all up to you! 

Happy coding!
The Cloud9 IDE team
