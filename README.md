Cloud9 setup for docker and flask mini-server
----------------------------------------------

Dockerfile builds a cloud9 environment from ws-cpp originally here: 

[ws-cpp](https://github.com/c9/templates/tree/master/ws-cpp)

but slightly customized/modified in the 'ws-cust' directory
of this repository.
